# TODO

## Bugs

- identity graph template exists but not identity graph data file!

## HTML Site

- Skill Links w/o corresponding portfolio work go to 404
- projects.html is a mess (one messy list)
- index.html is missing featured projects

## All Sites

- Should data download youtube talks

## Pypi

- Doesn't fetch tags, I don't think

## Readme

- Should sync top 6 pinned repos with featured projects in Readme.md

## Alternate Resume(s)

- Let people pick from a list of resume personas and see the corresponding resume cut down to relevant experience.

## Nice to do someday

- Make it unopinionated enough for a 2nd person to use this
- Publish to pypi, make it work after pip install
- bootstrapping for a pip installed version
- Make a 2nd theme
- Make 3rd party theming straight forward w/o forking
