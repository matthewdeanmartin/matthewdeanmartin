# Side Projects

Here is *side project* work. Commits before 2021 are hand written. Commits after 2021 are usually coded interactively with LLMs.

**Python Build and Package Tools**

- [pycodetags](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/pycodetags) Data-in-comments tool, for TODO tracking, based on PEP350
- [bitrab](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/bitrab) Run a `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline file locally **without** docker, as if were a Makefile or Justfile.
- [troml-dev-status](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/troml_dev_status) Get a trove development status based on objective criteria.
- [cli_tool_audit](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/cli_tool_audit/) Check for existence and version of tools not managed by your main package manager.
- [metametameta](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/metametameta) Generate metadata in source in an `__about__.py`, with version number, etc 🔢
- [pydoc_fork](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/pydoc_fork) Pydoc style HTML report tool suitable for CI
- [dashc](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/dashc) Compile python to a `python -c` invocation. Useful in certain yaml-based CI systems.
- [caniuseonlywheels](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/caniuseonlywheels) Wheel availability checker 🎡
- [bug_trail](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/bug_trail) Local error log/logging website for python. Somewhat inspired by .NET's Elmah. Intended to help with logging LLM/Agentic apps.

Novelties/Incomplete

- [so_pip](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/so_pip) Vendorization tool. Made obsolete by ChatGPT. 📦
- [git_mirror](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/git_mirror) Polyrepo tool. Not complete.

Significant LLM code in cli_tool_audit, git_mirror, metametameta.

**CLI Apps**

- [dedlin](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/dedlin) Text editor, similar to edlin. ✏️
- psyledger ... not yet published. Self administer daily psychology type tests.

**AI Projects build around LLMs**

- [examexam](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/examexam) Generate and take practice exams, such as the AWS certification exams.
- [ai_shell](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_shell) Autonomous sofware development with CLI tools optimized for use as LLM tool/function calls
- llm_build ... not yet published. Generate unit tests with LLMs.
- [ai_fish_tank](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_fish_tank) Proof of concept of a terminal fish tank with AI agents for each fish.

**Libraries**

- [random_names](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/random_names) Phrase to number and number to phrase. 🔢-🔤
- [whats_that_code](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/whats_that_code) Democratic source code identifier
- [untruncate_json](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/untruncate_json) Turn truncated json into valid json. Translation of someone elses javascript to python. Fast.

**Python Coding Novelties**

- [hissbytenotation](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/hissbytenotation) Use python dict source code as a data format.
- [markmodule](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/markmodule) Import python in a markdown file as if it was a python file.
- [markpickle](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/markpickle) Serialize python types to analogous types in Markdown. Not quite a DOM, not quite a usable serialization format either.
- [disemoji](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/disemoji) Disassemble to emoji symbols. Maps bytecode to emojis.

**Other People's Code I try to maintain**

- [openmock](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/openmock) Fork of elasticmock updated to work with Opensearch
- [terminaltables3](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/terminaltables3/) Fork of terminaltables, updated to have wheels, type hinting, tested against current python versions.

**Languages**

- Python (current main language) 🐍
- C# #️⃣
- Javascript/Typescript 🌐
- Terraform, CDK, Bash, Gitlab Pipelines
- Dabble in [Go](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/isopod_go), advanced [Bash](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/isopod_shell), [Ruby](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/isopod_ruby), [Rust](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/isopod_rust), PHP, [COBOL](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/isopod_cob), Lua, C, C++
- Ssh! Don't tell anyone I know TSQL, VBA, VB6, VB.NET. SQL is good. TSQL as a programming language is bad DX.
